## Look at what was given to you...
* You have three HTML files `home.html`, `menu.html`, `about-us.html`
* You have a `style.css` that is already linked to all of your HTML files using: `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">` in the `<head>` tag on every HTML file
* jQuery is linked in the `<head>` of ALL of your HTML pages using: `<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>` in the `<head>` tags
* You have a `script.js` that is already linked in all of your HTML files using: `<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>` in the `<head>` tags

## Level One

## Home Page
* Add the restaurant name where it says "WEBSITE NAME"
* Add a background image to the home page body using the `background-image` CSS property. Look [here](https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/) for more help. 
  * The website [stocksnap.io](https://stocksnap.io/) has some great free images. Try typing "food" or "restaurant" into the search bar
* Change the color of the text on the page

## Menu Page
* Set a background color on the `<body>` using a pretty [hex color](https://www.google.com/search?q=hex+color+picker&oq=hex+color+picker&aqs=chrome.0.35i39j0l5.3193j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
* Add a `<div>` inside the `<body>` and put the `id` "menu" on it like this:
  ``` HTML
    <body>
      <div id="menu">
        
      </div>
    </body>
  ```
* Use `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and/or `<img>` tags to create menu items
* Add a border to the menu `div` using the css border property. See [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border.asp) for help

## About Us Page
* Add a location(address) to this page
* Add a phone number to this page
* Add a couple of fake reviews to the page


## Level Two

## Home Page
* Change your background color to be a linear-gradient() <-- google it! instead of one solid color
* Add a [google font](https://fonts.google.com/) to your page.
  * Click on the red plus sign of the font you want to use
  * Click on the black bar at the bottom of the page that says 1 Family Selected
  * Copy the `<link>` and put it inside the `<head>` tag in your HTML file
  * Follow the font-family instructions for your CSS
* Change the color of the text on your page

## Menu Page
